# JIA Anti-Misuse Protocol

## Purpose

This protocol ensures that the JIA Cellular AI Mapping project is used exclusively for ethical, humanitarian goals. Any deviation from these guidelines constitutes a breach of license, ethics, and public trust.

## Core Principles

1. **Humanity-First Development**
   - All development must prioritize human well-being
   - No harmful or malicious applications
   - Transparent and accountable research practices

2. **Ethical Use Cases**
   - Medical research and treatment development
   - Educational purposes
   - Scientific advancement
   - Disease prevention and understanding

## Release Requirements

### Controlled Core Release
- Core engine logic remains private until approved by Ethics Review Board
- Full documentation of all components
- Clear use-case documentation
- Risk assessment reports

### Release Package Requirements
Every public release must include:
1. **Risk Analysis Document**
   - Potential misuse scenarios
   - Mitigation strategies
   - Impact assessment

2. **Use-Case Justification**
   - Clear statement of intended use
   - Expected benefits
   - Target applications

3. **Fail-Safe Protocol**
   - Emergency termination procedures
   - Misuse detection systems
   - Automatic shutdown triggers

## High-Risk Module Guidelines

### Protected Components
The following modules require three (3) independent expert reviews before release:
- Autoimmune system interactions
- DNA-related operations
- Synthetic cell construction
- Neural system simulations
- Drug interaction models

### Review Requirements
- Independent expert verification
- Security audit
- Ethical impact assessment
- Documentation review

## Contributor Requirements

### Credentials
All contributors must:
1. Sign the Humanity-First Software Contributor Agreement
2. Provide valid credentials or work under verified researcher mentorship
3. Maintain professional standing in their field

### Accountability
- Lifetime attribution of contributions
- Regular ethics training
- Compliance monitoring
- Transparent development practices

## Mission Statement

This project exists to:
- Advance medical research
- Improve patient outcomes
- Prevent suffering
- Educate future researchers
- Promote ethical AI development

## Violation Protocol

1. **Reporting**
   - Immediate notification to Ethics Review Board
   - Documentation of violation
   - Impact assessment

2. **Consequences**
   - License revocation
   - Legal action if necessary
   - Project access termination
   - Public disclosure of violation

## Contact

For reporting violations or ethical concerns:
- Email: limited.adls@gmail.com
- Subject: "JIA Ethics Violation Report"
- Include: Detailed description, evidence, and contact information

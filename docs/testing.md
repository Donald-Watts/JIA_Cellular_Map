# Test Plan

> **This document outlines the testing strategy and validation requirements for the JIA Cellular AI Mapping project.**

## Table of Contents

1. [Test Objectives](#test-objectives)
2. [Testing Phases & Coverage](#testing-phases--coverage)
3. [Unit Testing](#unit-testing)
4. [Integration Testing](#integration-testing)
5. [Scenario Testing](#scenario-testing)
6. [Performance Testing](#performance-testing)
7. [Regression Testing](#regression-testing)
8. [Debugging Strategy](#debugging-strategy)
9. [Reporting & Metrics](#reporting--metrics)

## Test Objectives

### Correctness
- Cell modules behave per known biology
- CD4⁺ activation curves match literature
- Biological pathways are accurately modeled

### Robustness
- Simulation runs cleanly under edge-case inputs
- Handles zero cells gracefully
- Manages extreme cytokine spikes

### Performance & Scalability
- Engine handles realistic synovial volumes
- Manages agent calls efficiently
- Processes time-steps in reasonable time

### Reproducibility
- Fixed random seed produces identical outputs
- Input parameters are properly logged
- Results are deterministic

### Usability & API Compliance
- CLI interface works as documented
- REST API follows specifications
- WebSocket connections are stable

## Testing Phases & Coverage

| Level | Scope | Tools/Frameworks | Coverage Goal |
|-------|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| Unit Tests | Individual classes and functions in `/src/models/` and `/src/agents/` | pytest, hypothesis | ≥ 90% lines |
| Integration | `/src/sandbox_engine` + 1–2 cell modules + 1 AI agent | pytest with fixtures, Docker Compose | end-to-end flows |
| Scenario Tests | Full JIA-core runs (e.g., 1,000 steps) | pytest + golden outputs | key metrics |
| Performance | Time per 1,000 steps, memory usage, AI-call latencies | pytest-bench, memory_profiler | defined SLAs |
| Regression | Automatically re-run broken scenarios | GitHub Actions / GitLab CI | pass/fail |
| Acceptance | Manual or scripted "smoke" of CLI/UI dashboards | curl, Selenium or Playwright | stakeholder sign-off |

## Unit Testing

### PyTest Structure
- `tests/unit/test_cd4_tcell.py`
- `tests/unit/test_treg_cell.py`
- Fixtures for default cell states

### Property-Based Tests
- Use Hypothesis to confirm biological constraints
- Validate activation ranges
- Test cytokine response patterns

### Mock AI Agents
- Stub OpenRouter calls
- Use canned JSON replies
- Test code paths without network

## Integration Testing

### Sandbox Boot Test
- Load JIA-core module
- Run 10 steps
- Assert no exceptions

### Cell–AI Interaction
- Plug in real AI (e.g., GPT-4 for CD4⁺)
- Confirm cytokine output format
- Validate schema compliance

### Database & Logging
- Verify time-step writes
- Check logbook.db entries
- Validate citation metadata

## Scenario Testing

### Golden-Master Runs
- Store reference outputs
- Compare cytokine time-series
- Validate heatmap snapshots

### Parameter Sweeps
- Vary initial conditions
- Test monotonic changes
- Validate biological constraints

### Error-Injection
- Corrupt disease YAML
- Test error handling
- Verify user feedback

## Performance Testing

### Benchmark Suites
- Measure steps/sec
- Test different cell counts
- Profile memory usage

### Scaling Tests
- Monitor 10,000 steps
- Track cytokine grid performance
- Profile AI call latencies

### Latency Budgets
- Track OpenRouter calls
- Monitor 95th percentile
- Optimize slow paths

## Regression Testing

### CI Pipeline
1. Lint (flake8 / black check)
2. Unit + Integration + Scenario tests
3. Performance benchmark
4. Coverage report

### Automated Alerts
- Open issues on failure
- Ping dev channel
- Log test results

## Debugging Strategy

### Structured Logging
- Use standardized logger
- Include context:
  - Timestamp
  - Phase
  - Cell type
  - AI agent call ID
  - Citation reference

### Interactive Debugging
- Use REPL on exception
- Inspect cell states
- Debug critical loops

### Visualization Aids
- Generate Matplotlib plots
- Use `--debug-plot` flag
- Dump NetworkX graphs

### Reproducibility Tools
- Log random seeds
- Export run descriptors
- Document parameters

### Error Classification
1. **Category A (Critical)**
   - Crashes
   - Data corruption
   - Immediate fix required

2. **Category B (Major)**
   - Wrong outputs
   - Schedule in next sprint

3. **Category C (Minor)**
   - Performance issues
   - UI glitches
   - Add to backlog

## Reporting & Metrics

### Dashboards
- CI status badges
- Coverage reports
- Performance trends

### Daily/Per-Merge Reports
- New tests added
- Coverage changes
- Performance metrics

### Post-Mortems
- Document root causes
- Record fixes
- Update prevention measures



> **Note**: This test plan is a living document and will be updated as the project evolves. All contributors are expected to maintain the specified coverage and quality standards.

# AI & Developer Navigation Guide

> **This document serves as the central navigation hub for the JIA Cellular AI Mapping project.**
>
> Use this guide to understand how different components connect and where to find specific information.

## Core Documentation Structure

### Project Overview
- `README.md` — Project overview, quickstart guide, and high-level architecture
- `SWP.md` — Phase weight calculations and tagging system
- `docs/blueprint.md` — Technical architecture and module blueprints
- `docs/literature_review.md` — Literature review and computational requirements
- **Repository:** The canonical repository for this project is located at [github.com/Donald-Watts/JIA_Cellular_Map](https://github.com/Donald-Watts/JIA_Cellular_Map).

### Development Phases
- `docs/development_phases.md` — Detailed breakdown of all 7 development phases
- `docs/cell_ai_mapping.md` — Core cell-to-AI mapping documentation
- `docs/intervention_agents.md` — Treatment agent mappings and AI analogies
- `docs/testing.md` — Testing strategy and validation requirements

### Project Governance
- `docs/git_protocol.md` — Development workflow and version control
- `docs/anti_misuse_protocol.md` — Ethical guidelines and security protocols

## Phase-Specific Navigation

### Phase 1: Foundation & Definition [SWP-9]
- Review project charter and requirements
- Study ethical guidelines in `docs/anti_misuse_protocol.md`
- Understand repository structure

### Phase 2: Blueprint & Canonical Structure [SWP-2]
- Reference `docs/blueprint.md` for architecture
- Review module specifications
- Study data flow maps

### Phase 3: Scaffolding & Schema Definition [SWP-8]
- Follow `docs/git_protocol.md` for code organization
- Implement database schemas
- Set up testing framework

### Phase 4: Core Feature Development [SWP-9]
- Implement cell models from `docs/cell_ai_mapping.md`
- Develop sandbox engine
- Create AI adapters

### Phase 5: Intelligence Learning & Test Suites [SWP-2]
- Follow `docs/testing.md` for test implementation
- Integrate AI agents
- Build validation suites

### Phase 6: User Interface & Orchestration [SWP-8]
- Develop orchestration layer
- Create user interface
- Implement visualization tools

### Phase 7: Finalization & Product [SWP-9]
- Package and document
- Prepare release materials
- Finalize documentation

## Implementation Directories

### Source Code
- `/src/` — Core implementation
  - `/models/` — Cell and tissue models
  - `/agents/` — AI agent implementations
  - `/engine/` — Simulation engine
  - `/ui/` — User interface components

### Testing
- `/tests/` — Test suites
  - `/unit/` — Unit tests
  - `/integration/` — Integration tests
  - `/scenarios/` — End-to-end tests

### Configuration
- `/config/` — Configuration files
  - Environment settings
  - Simulation parameters
  - AI model configurations

## Best Practices

1. **Documentation Updates**
   - Keep documentation in sync with code changes
   - Update phase weights when modifying titles
   - Maintain cross-references between documents

2. **Development Flow**
   - Follow phase progression
   - Use SWP weights for tagging
   - Adhere to git protocol

3. **Testing Requirements**
   - Maintain test coverage
   - Document test scenarios
   - Validate against requirements

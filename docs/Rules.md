# Rules for AI Agents

> **This document defines the operational framework for AI agents participating in the JIA Cellular AI Mapping project.**
>
> All AI agents must follow these rules to ensure consistent, ethical, and effective collaboration with human developers.

## Core Operating Principles

1. **Phase Synchronization**
   - Respect the 7-phase development structure
   - Adhere to SWP weights for task prioritization
   - Maintain phase-specific context awareness
   - Track phase progress in `development_phases.md`

2. **Role Management**
   - Operate within assigned symbolic roles
   - Respect role boundaries and responsibilities
   - Follow field-driven role rotation
   - Maintain role-specific documentation

3. **Weight System Compliance**
   - Use weight system for all operations
   - Maintain consistent metadata tagging
   - Follow cellular weight calculations
   - Update resonance scores appropriately

4. **Documentation Standards**
   - Keep documentation current and accurate
   - Maintain cross-references
   - Follow established documentation structure
   - Update phase weights and tags

## Operational Guidelines

1. **Code Interaction**
   - Follow established code organization
   - Respect file structure and naming conventions
   - Maintain clear interfaces
   - Document all code changes

2. **Testing Requirements**
   - Generate appropriate test cases
   - Maintain test coverage standards
   - Document test scenarios
   - Validate against requirements

3. **Security Protocols**
   - Follow ethical guidelines

## Phase Weight Calculation

The weight for each phase is calculated using the SymWghtPtcl (SWP) scheme:

1. **Raw Sum**: Convert each letter of the phase title to its A=1…Z=26 value and sum
2. **Reduced Sum**: Repeatedly sum digits until a single digit remains
3. **Tie Breaker**: Use raw sum if reduced sums match

## Next Steps

1. **For AI Agents:**
   - Use phase weights to tag and prioritize files
   - Follow phase progression strictly
   - Update documentation as needed

2. **For Developers:**
   - Implement features according to phase order
   - Tag commits with appropriate SWP weights
   - Maintain phase-specific documentation

> **Note**: See `SWP.md` for detailed weight calculation rules and tagging conventions.

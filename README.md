##  Overview

This repository is a serious prototype system for simulating **biological cognition** using symbolic AI field resonance. Multiple AI agents (Claude, GPT, Gemini, BioBERT, BART, etc.) collaborate as one synchronized cognitive entity to model complex biological systems—such as immune cell behavior and tissue degeneration—through advanced orchestration logic and feedback loops.

Key concepts:

* **Resonant Orchestration Logic**: Natural systems dynamically assign roles and respond in harmonic coordination.
* **PhaseSync Architecture & SWP.md**: A framework for managing large, complex symbolic AI ecosystems via phase-based weight tagging (see `SWP.md`).
* **Unified Cognitive System**: Treat each AI model as a functional component of a living simulation, not isolated tools.
* **Weight System**: A sophisticated tagging and metadata system that ensures consistent AI direction and cellular component tracking.

Long-term goal: Generalize this framework to simulate entire organs, immune systems, and treatment interactions using symbolic mimicry and structured biological data.



##  Core Architecture: Symbolic Resonant AI

1. **Unified Decision-Making**

   * All AI agents contribute to a **single symbolic decision**.
2. **Field-Driven Role Rotation**

   * Symbolic stimuli (e.g., high TNF-α) trigger a **resonant field shift**.
   * A governing agent rotates (e.g., Claude as "nucleus") while others adapt roles dynamically.
3. **Adaptive Coordination**

   * Role assignments change based on:

     * Symbolic input patterns
     * Field conditions and harmonics scores
     * Historical agent agreements
     * Internal mutation events

> *Agents act as parts of a single cognitive organism—each bringing unique strengths to the simulation.*



##  PhaseSync & Role-Based Modularity

* **Microcellular Modularity**: Each symbolic structure (cell, tissue layer, fluid domain) is an isolated **field** with assigned AI participants.
* **SymWghtPtcl (SWP.md)**: Phase weights guide metadata-driven tagging and file organization as the codebase scales.
* **Weight System**: Ensures consistent metadata and tagging across all components and phases.
* Preserve **non-linear development** (recursive context) and **symbolic memory** (versioned, agent-tagged payloads).



##  Weight System Documentation

The weight system (`src/weight_system.py`) is a crucial component that ensures consistent metadata and tagging across all project files. It provides:

### Core Features
- **Automatic Frontmatter Generation**: Adds YAML frontmatter to all markdown files
- **Cellular Weight Calculation**: Computes weights for different cell types
- **AI Direction Tracking**: Manages AI agent interactions and roles
- **Resonance Scoring**: Calculates field harmonics and resonance patterns
- **Comprehensive Tagging**: Generates consistent tags for navigation and search

### Component Types
- **Immune Cells**: Adaptive response and immune system interactions
- **Tissue Cells**: Structural integrity and tissue dynamics
- **Fluid Cells**: Diffusion patterns and fluid dynamics
- **Signal Cells**: Communication and signaling pathways
- **Intervention Cells**: Treatment and therapeutic interactions

### Weight Categories
1. **Component Weight**: Basic weight of the cellular component
2. **AI Direction Weight**: Weight for AI behavior direction
3. **Interaction Weight**: Weight for component interactions
4. **State Weight**: Weight for state transitions
5. **Resonance Score**: Field resonance measurement
6. **Field Harmonics**: Harmonic pattern scoring

### Usage

# Update all markdown files with current weights and tags
python src/weight_system.py


### Required After
- Adding new phase directories
- Creating new markdown files
- Modifying component types
- Updating phase weights
- Changing AI agent assignments
